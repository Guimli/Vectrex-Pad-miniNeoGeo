# Vectrex Pad miniNeoGeo

Allows you to convert a mini NeoGeo controller into a Vectrex controller.

This PCB reuses the analog pad of the mini NeoGeo controller. You will have to unsolder it from the original PCB.
There are two models of the NeoGeo mini controller. One contains classic directional switches (you can hear the clicks when using the directional controller). The other one uses an analogue pad. Make sure you have the right model of controller (the one with the analogue pad) before you start making this Vectrex mod.

!!! Please note that the PCB must be 1.2mm thick !!!
!!! Another warning: It is essential to cut the pins of the two auto-fire switches SW5 and SW6 (OS203011MS1QP1) at the level of the PCB BEFORE soldering. This is because the plastic of the lower part of the joystick has two rings that press on this area. Over soldering in this area could block the auto-fire buttons and deform the plastic at the back.

The Star and Select buttons have been replaced by an auto-fire on the A and D buttons (equivalent to the 1 and 4 button of the Vectrex controller).

## Three possible modes:

> Auto-fire disabled

> Auto-fire when the button is active.

> Auto-fire when the button is inactive (press the button to disables the auto-fire).

The SMD electronics are positioned on one side only to facilitate factory production.
