# Vectrex Pad miniNeoGeo

Allows you to convert a mini NeoGeo controller into a Vectrex controller.

This PCB reuses the analog pad of the mini NeoGeo controller. You will have to unsolder it from the original PCB.

The Star and Select buttons have been replaced by an auto-fire on the A and D buttons (equivalent to the 1 and 4 button of the Vectrex controller).

## Three possible modes:

> Auto-fire disabled

> Auto-fire when the button is active.

> Auto-fire when the button is inactive (press the button to disables the auto-fire).

The SMD electronics are positioned on one side only to facilitate factory production.
